# UnityTemplate
Tired of spending time setting up a new Unity Project in github when deciding to make a new project or prototype?

Well not any more. You can use this project as a template for your next Unity Project.

Unity template setup with .gitignore and .gitattributes with LFS

Usage:
1. Click the [Use this template] on github
2. Setup repo as normal
3. Clone new repo
4. Rename the TemplateProject folder to whatever you want for your Unity Project
5. If you really want you can rebase and errase all the history so it looks like you started this project already setup with your correct name instead of history like "setup template project"
